The Seg3D viewer is the main interface between the users and the software. This viewer is meant to be highly interactive and intuitive. Using a combination of mouse functions, keyboard shortcuts, and visual buttons the users can quickly visualize and segment data. This chapter will describe the functionality of several aspects of the Seg3D viewer including the overall layout of the interface, 2D slice viewer, 3D volume viewer, and the various viewing options available.

The default layout when Seg3D is opened and a new project is created is shown in <a href="#blank">Figure 3.1</a>. As seen from the image the interface for Seg3D consists of a number of viewers (both 2D and 3D), windows to control the functionality of Seg3D, and a tool bar at the bottom of the screen.
