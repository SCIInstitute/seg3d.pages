Anytime you start Seg3D, users are first presented with the Seg3D welcome screen. As seen in <a href="#welcome">Figure 2.1</a>, the welcome screen consists of the Seg3D splash screen and a menu displaying the available options for starting and continuing a segmentation in Seg3D. The included options are to load a recent project, open existing project, start a new project, quickly open a file for viewing, and to quit Seg3D. These options are the same as some of the options in the **File** menu which are explained in this chapter as well as [Sec.Â 5.1](Manuals/Functions/File.md).
