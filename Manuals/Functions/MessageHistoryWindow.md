## Description

The Message History Window is not opened by default when Seg3D is opened. This window is opened by clicking on the message history icon in the bottom left of the screen in the tool bar ([TODO Table 3.7](#toolbaricons)). This window will show the messages that Seg3D displays when many functions are performed. This can be used to track your steps at a high level.
