## Description

### Summary

This filter calculates the Gradient magnitude of a data layer and output in a data layer.

### Detailed Description

The gradient magnitude filter will calculate the gradient magnitude of a data layer and output a new or replaced data layer containing the gradient magnitude. The gradient magnitude is useful as it can highlight regions with edges in the data image because those regions have high gradients.

This filter is very simple to use because there is only one input and no parameters to adjust, so choose a data layer and go.
